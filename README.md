PURPOSE

The Dewey Decimal System is fundamental to how everything is organised in the library. But the head librarian has found that even novice librarians sometimes get bored when they must learn about the details of the system. The purpose of the training software that you will develop for the library, is to make learning about the system fun and engaging.
After using the training software, the user must be able to:

• Identify which broad area a book belongs to.
• Find the call number for a specific topic.
• Correctly replace a book in its position on a shelf.
