### Purpose
The Dewey Decimal System is fundamental to how everything is organised in the library.

But the head librarian has found that even novice librarians sometimes get bored when they must learn about the details of the system. 

The purpose of the training software that you will develop for the library, is to make learning about the system fun and engaging.

After using the training software, the user must be able to:

-  Identify which broad area a book belongs to.
-  Find the call number for a specific topic.
-  Correctly replace a book in its position on a shelf.

## Final POE
1.  Create a file containing the data that was gathered in the research part of this task in a format that your application can read.  
2.  Enable the Finding call numbers task.  
3.  When the user chooses Finding call numbers, the application must load the Dewey Decimal classification data into memory from the file created in Step 1.  
4.  The quiz must work as follows:  
-  For each question, randomly select a third-level entry from the data, for example, 752 Color. Display only the description, not the call number.  
-  Display four top-level options to the user to choose between, one of which must be the correct one and the other three randomly selected incorrect answers. For example: 000 General 400 Language 700 Arts & Recreation (Correct answer) 800 Literature  
- For the options, display both the call number and description. Display the options in numerical order by call number.  
- If the user selects the correct option, show them four options from the next level until the most detailed level is reached.  
- If the user selects the wrong option anywhere along the way, indicate this and then ask the next question.  
5. Implement a gamification feature to motivate users to keep using the application. You may use the same one as before or choose to implement a different one.
